## 📌 Key Insights & Business Impact

- 🔍 **Production Department Dominates Headcount & Terminations**  
  The majority of employees belong to the Production department, which also shows the highest number of performance issues and terminations — a red flag for potential burnout or management challenges.

- 🎯 **Employees in Their 30s & 40s Are Most Vulnerable to Attrition**  
  The age distribution shows that most employees fall within the 30–50 range, which also corresponds with higher termination counts — this could indicate mid-career disengagement or lack of growth opportunities.

- 👩‍💼 **Female Representation is Strong at 56.6%**  
  The gender ratio leans slightly female, with balanced distribution across departments — a positive indicator for diversity and inclusion efforts.

- 📉 **Most Terminations Due to “Still Employed” Status or Undefined Reasons**  
  A large portion of terminations are labeled "N/A - Still Employed," suggesting either ongoing employment or data entry inconsistencies — which HR may need to clean or clarify for better tracking.

- 😊 **Employee Satisfaction Averages 3.9/5, But Engagement Varies Widely**  
  While satisfaction is relatively high, the engagement scatterplot shows that high satisfaction doesn’t always lead to high engagement — further investigation into motivation and leadership quality might help.

- ⚠️ **Performance Score Disparities Noted Across Departments**  
  Most "Needs Improvement" and "PIP" (Performance Improvement Plan) scores are from Production and IT/IS — possibly linked to workload, inadequate training, or unclear KPIs.
